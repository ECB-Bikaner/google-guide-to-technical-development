## Technical Development Guide

This guide provides tips and resources to help you develop your technical skills (academically and non-academically) through self-paced, hands-on learning.

This guide is intended for Computer Science students seeking an internship or university grad role at Google.

### What this guide is for

- You can use this guide to determine which courses to take, but be sure to stay on track with your courses required for your major to graduate.
- We encourage you to learn more outside of this guide. The more you know, the better!
- The online resources we’ve cited aren’t meant to replace courses available at your university, but they may help supplement your education or provide an introduction to a topic.
- The information and recommendations in this guide were gathered through our work with students and candidates in the field. It is a work-in-progress, a living document, so be sure to periodically check back for updates.

**Note:** Following the recommendations in the guide does not guarantee a job at Google.

### How to use this guide

- The guide lists topics and resources in a rough progression, from possible places to begin if you have little or no technical skills, to resources for those with increasing skills, to ways to gain exposure in the Computer Sciences field.
- You can use any of the resources you want, in any order.
